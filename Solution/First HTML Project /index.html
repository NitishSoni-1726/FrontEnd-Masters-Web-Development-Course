          <h3>A small Introduction about the show</h3>
          <p>
            Family Guy is an American animated sitcom originally conceived and
            created by Seth MacFarlane for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The
            show centers around the Griffins, a dysfunctional family consisting
            of parents Peter and Lois; their children, Meg, Chris, and Stewie;
            and their anthropomorphic pet dog, Brian. Set in the fictional city
            of Quahog, Rhode Island, the show exhibits much of its humor in the
            form of metafictional cutaway gags that often lampoon American
            culture.

              Stewart "Stewie" Gilligan Griffin is a fictional character from
              the animated television series Family Guy. He was born in 1998 and
              is voiced by the series creator Seth MacFarlane and first appeared
              on television, along with the rest of the Griffin family, in a
              15-minute short on December 20, 1998. Stewie was created and
              designed by MacFarlane himself, who was asked to pitch a pilot to
              the Fox Broadcasting Company, based on The Life of Larry and Larry
              & Steve, two shorts made by MacFarlane featuring a middle-aged man
              named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. After the pilot was
              given the green light, the Griffin family appeared in the episode
              "Death Has a Shadow".
            </p>
            <p>
              Stewie is a highly precocious toddler who talks and acts as an
              adult. He began the series as a megalomaniacal sociopath,
              initially obsessed with violence, matricide, and world domination.
              He is the third child of Peter and Lois Griffin, the youngest
              brother of Meg, and the younger brother of Chris. Throughout the
              series, particularly following the two episode arc "Stewie Kills
              Lois" and "Lois Kills Stewie", the violent aspects of Stewie's
              personality were toned down, and he has evolved into an eccentric,
              friendly, bisexual and flamboyant scamp (something possibly
              foreshadowed in the direct-to-video film Stewie Griffin: The
              Untold Story). He has also come to have a very close friendship
              with the family's anthropomorphic dog, Brian, whom he originally
              used to antagonize in the earliest episodes. Stewie is considered
              to be the show's breakout character and has received numerous
              award nominations from writers such as Jodiss Pierre.

              Peter Löwenbräu Griffin Sr. (born Justin Peter Griffin) is a
              fictional character and the main protagonist of the American
              animated sitcom Family Guy. He is voiced by the series' creator,
              Seth MacFarlane, and first appeared on television, along with the
              rest of the Griffin family, in the 15-minute pilot pitch of Family
              Guy on December 20, 1998. Peter was created and designed by
              MacFarlane himself. MacFarlane was asked to pitch a pilot to the
              Fox Broadcasting Company based on Larry & Steve, a short made by
              MacFarlane which featured a middle-aged character named Larry and
              an intellectual dog, Steve. After the series pilot was given the
              green light, the Griffin family appeared in the episode "Death Has
              a Shadow".
            </p>
            <p>
              Peter is married to Lois and is the father of Meg, Chris, and
              Stewie. He also has a dog named Brian, with whom he is best
              friends. He has worked at a toy factory and at Quahog's Brewery.
              Peter's voice was inspired by the security guards that MacFarlane
              heard at his school. His appearance was a redesign of the
              protagonist Larry from MacFarlane's previous animated short films
              The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve. He has appeared in several
              pieces of Family Guy merchandise, including toys, T-shirts, and
              video games, and he has made crossover appearances in other shows,
              including The Simpsons, Drawn Together, American Dad!, and Family
              Guy's spin-off series The Cleveland Show.

              Meg Griffin is a fictional character in the animated television
              series Family Guy. Meg is the eldest child of Peter and Lois
              Griffin and older sister of Stewie and Chris, but is also the
              family's scapegoat who receives the least of their attention and
              tolerates the brunt of their abuse. She is often bullied,
              belittled, ridiculed, and ignored.
            </p>
            <p>
              Meg first appeared on television, along with the rest of the

            <p>
              H. Brian Griffin is a fictional character from the American
              animated television series Family Guy. An anthropomorphic white
              labrador retriever[citation needed] voiced by Seth MacFarlane, he
              is one of the show's main characters as a member of the Griffin
              family. He primarily works in the series as a less-than-adept
              writer struggling to find himself, attempting essays, novels,
              screenplays, and newspaper articles.
            </p>
            <p>
              He first appeared on television, along with the rest of the
              family, in a 15-minute short on December 20, 1998. Brian was
              created and designed by MacFarlane himself. MacFarlane was asked
              to pitch a pilot to the Fox Broadcasting Company, based on The
              Life of Larry and Larry & Steve, two shorts made by MacFarlane
              featuring a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual
              dog, Steve. These two are now considered as Peter and Brian. After
              the pilot was given the green light, the Griffin family appeared
              in the episode "Death Has a Shadow".
            </p>
            <p>
              Brian has been featured in many items of merchandise for Family
              Guy, and he is considered to be one of the show's biggest
              merchandising characters. He has also made crossover appearances
              in the other MacFarlane-produced shows, such as American Dad! and
              The Cleveland Show.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a character, Brian was initially very well received by critics
              although reception in later years has been mixed. When Brian was
              killed off in the season 12 episode "Life of Brian", the events of
              the episode received substantial attention from the media and
              elicited strongly negative reactions from fans of the show. Brian
              subsequently returned two episodes later, in "Christmas Guy",
              after Stewie, his best friend, traveled back in time to save him.

              brother of Stewie Griffin and the younger brother of Meg Griffin.
              He is voiced by the American actor, producer and writer, Seth
              Green, and first appeared on television, along with the rest of

              is later revealed that the monkey is not evil), his frequent
              masturbation, and his perverted admirer, the elderly Herbert who
              lusts after and repeatedly tries to prey on him throughout the

              1998. Lois was created and designed by series creator Seth
              MacFarlane, and was asked to pitch a pilot to the Fox Broadcasting
              Company based on Larry and Steve, a short he made which featured a

              kleptomaniac. Lois has also had several affairs, one of which
              allegedly resulted in the conception of Chris.
