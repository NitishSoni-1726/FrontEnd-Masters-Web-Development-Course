                <h2>Americano</h2>
                <h3>What is an americano coffee?</h3>
                <p>
                  An americano is quite simply just hot water and espresso.
                  It’ll either be served 1/2 and 1/2 or 1/3 espresso to 2/3
                  water, depending on the coffee shop in question or how you’ve
                  chosen to brew it. There is dispute about whether the espresso
                  or the water should be added first, but in the case of the
                  americano, espresso should always be added first as the crema
                  mixes in and creates a more mellow, even taste. But some
                  people may add it depending on their personal preference.
                  Whilst most other espresso-based coffee drinks include milk,
                  such as the cappuccino or latte, the americano stands out
                  amongst them.

                  Traditionally, there will be no milk but some people may add
                  it depending on their personal preference.  Whilst most other
                  espresso-based coffee drinks include milk, such as the

                <h3>Americano origins</h3>
                <p>
                  The americano finds its origins in World War II.
                  Interestingly, American soldiers stationed in Italy didn’t
                  care for the very strong espresso that was favoured in the
                  country, therefore they tried to recreate their beloved drip
                  coffee from back home by adding water to the espresso shot.
                  The result? The americano that we know and love today.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The americano also used to be iced. The process of making it
                  was the same, but cold water was used instead and ice cubes
                  were added.

                <h3>What is a cortado coffee?</h3>
                <p>
                  Unlike other coffee types the milk isn’t texturised and
                  instead, Cortado coffee is made with lightly steamed milk, no
                  froth or foam. The steamed milk on top reduces the acidity of
                  the coffee and creates a micro-foam which doesn’t separate
                  from the espresso, giving it a strong and rich flavour.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Cortado translates to cut, meaning that the coffee is cut with
                  milk. A cortado coffee is made of equal parts espresso and
                  steamed milk. It is served with a double shot espresso.
                </p>
                <h3>Cortado origins</h3>
                <p>
                  ere’s not much known about the origins of the cortado, aside
                  from the fact that it came from Spain’s Basque Country. It’s
                  also popular in Portugal and Latin America, where it’s
                  commonly enjoyed as an afternoon treat.

                <h3>What is mocha coffee?</h3>
                <p>
                  Although a mocha is often interpreted differently across the
                  world, the basis is that a shot of espresso is combined with a
                  chocolate powder or syrup, followed by milk or cream. It is a
                  variant of a latte, in the sense that it is often 1/3 espresso
                  and 2/3 steamed milk. However, a chocolate flavour is added,
                  and this can be milk or dark.
                </p>
                <h3>What does mocha mean?</h3>
                <p>
                  Essentially, 'mocha' means a type of good quality coffee that
                  is made from a specific coffee bean. The beans are from the
                  plant species called Coffee Arabica, and it was originally
                  only grown in Mocha, Yemen. It also means a mixture of coffee
                  and chocolate, or a flavouring that tastes of this.

                <h3>What does a mocha taste like?</h3>
                <p>
                  It is said that a mocha tastes like a chocolatey coffee.
                  Whilst this is true, a mocha is so much more than that. Where
                  the espresso shot offers an almost bitter taste, the chocolate
                  combination creates a sweetness to create a velvety smooth,
                  luxurious beverage.
                </p>
                <h3>Mocha origin – where did it come from?</h3>
                <p>
                  Now we understand what a mocha is, where exactly did it come
                  from? It is believed that the drink was originally named after
                  the mocha bean, which is a type of coffee bean shipped from
                  the port of Al Mokka in Yemen. Mocha beans were known for
                  their naturally chocolatey flavour. These days, the name mocha
                  doesn’t reference these coffee beans as such, but rather the
                  presence of added chocolate flavourings in the coffee drink.

                <h3>What is a macchiato?</h3>
                <p>
                  In Italian, the term "macchiato" translates as "marked" or
                  "stained", meaning a stained or marked coffee. The macchiato
                  is an espresso coffee drink, topped with a small amount of
                  foamed or steamed milk to allow the taste of the espresso to
                  still shine through.

                </div>
                <p>
                  The macchiato is an espresso coffee drink, topped with a small
                  amount of foamed or steamed milk to allow the taste of the
                  espresso to still shine through. A macchiato is perfect for
                  those who find espresso too harsh in flavour, but a cappuccino
                  too weak.
                </p>
                <h3>Macchiato origins</h3>
                <p>
                  The origin of the name "macchiato" stems from baristas needing
                  to show waiters the difference between an espresso shot and an
                  espresso with a bit of milk in it. As the latter is "marked"
                  or "stained" by the addition of milk, it was quickly given its
                  name to highlight the addition. Unlike the cappuccino,
                  originally being created exclusively for that morning coffee,
                  the macchiato is the perfect afternoon coffee.
                </p>
                <h3>Types of macchiato</h3>
                <p>
                  There are two main types of macchiato coffee: the espresso
                  macchiato and the latte macchiato.
                </p>
                <h3>What is an espresso macchiato?</h3>
                <p>
                  The original macchiato is made with a shot of espresso,
                  diluted slightly by 1-2 teaspoons of steamed milk, which is
                  the "stain". The espresso macchiato has the highest ratio of
                  espresso to milk, and the addition of milk is meant to be
                  complementary, so the espresso can still be very much tasted.
                </p>
                <h3>What is a latte macchiato?</h3>
                <p>
                  The latte macchiato is a sweeter, layered espresso beverage.
                  It is made by adding a shot or half a shot of espresso to
                  steamed milk, topped with a milk foam layer. Unlike an
                  espresso macchiato, which is served in a short glass, a latte
                  macchiato is served in a tall glass.

                  A flat white is a blend of micro-foamed milk poured over a
                  single or double shot of espresso. This microfoam is steamed
                  milk infused with air, to create a smooth and velvety texture
                  and creamy taste. Precise pouring and steaming of the
                  microfoam is essential in making a flat white.

                  The origins of the flat white coffee have caused a strong
                  debate. Both Australia and New Zealand claim to have invented
                  the flat white in the 1980s. The answer is still unclear and
                  it’s likely that the flat white evolved in both countries.

                <p>
                  Decaf coffee is made from regular coffee beans that go through
                  a process to remove the majority of the caffeine. However,
                  decaffeinated coffee is not completely caffeine free, and EU
                  regulation for decaf coffee is less than 0.3% caffeine.
                </p>
                <h3>Origins of decaf coffee</h3>
                <p>
                  Now we know what decaf coffee is, where did it come from?
                  Decaf coffee was first commercially available in 1906 in
                  Germany. Created by Ludwig Roselius, who thought his father
                  died of too much caffeine, he made it his mission to create a
                  blend that had all of the taste without what he thought was
                  ‘poison’. However, he found the answer to his problems by
                  accident. During one of the coffee bean shipments a box got
                  immersed in seawater and when brewed it was discovered that
                  the water had removed most of the caffeine content from the
                  beans. This revelation led to Roselius, patenting a way of
                  steaming coffee to remove the caffeine and it’s still a
                  process which is used today
                </p>
                <h3>
                  Differences between decaffeinated and caffeinated coffee
                </h3>
                <p>
                  When people discover what is decaf coffee, they often wonder
                  what the difference is to regular caffeinated coffee. Aside
                  from the significantly reduced caffeine content, there’s
                  usually only a very slight difference in taste and smell. But,
                  providing you’re purchasing a quality coffee such as what we
                  offer in our wonderful NESCAFÉ decaf range, you won’t have to
                  compromise on taste.

                <h3>What is an Irish coffee?</h3>
                <p>
                  Irish coffee has four main ingredients: coffee, Irish whiskey,
                  sugar and cream. But there are many variations of this classic
                  coffee drink, which we willl explore later.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When making an Irish coffee, it’s important to ensure the
                  coffee is strong and the whiskey is Irish, as it’s simply not
                  an Irish coffee if you use Scotch whiskey. The coffee drink is
                  drunk through its creamy head. To ensure the cream floats on
                  top of the coffee and doesn’t sink, you can whip or blend the
                  cream before layering it on top of the coffee with a spoon.

                  Irish coffee has four main ingredients: coffee, Irish whiskey,
                  sugar and cream. But there are many variations of this classic
                  coffee drink, some of which include steamed milk.

                <h3>Irish coffee history</h3>
                <p>
                  Now that we understand what an Irish coffee is, let’s explore
                  its origins and where it came from.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whilst the idea of alcoholic hot coffee drinks has been around
                  for some time, dating back to the mid-nineteenth century in
                  Viennese, German and Denmark coffee houses. The Irish coffee,
                  was said to have first been created in the 1940s by Joe
                  Sheridan, chef at Foynes Port near Limerick, Ireland.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1943, a Pan Am flying boat flight to New York turned back
                  to Foynes due to bad weather. Sheridan was asked to come back
                  to the airport and prepare hot food and drinks for the
                  passengers, who were feeling the winter weather. Sheridan
                  whipped up a concoction that would warm up the passengers.
                  When an American passenger asked if this concoction was a
                  Brazilian coffee, Sheridan replied that it was an Irish
                  coffee.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1951, travel writer Stanton Delaplane sampled Sheridan's
                  Irish Coffee at Foynes Airport. He introduced this new coffee
                  to Jack Koeppler, the owner of The Buena Vista hotel, and
                  asked him to recreate this coffee. But, after many attempts,
                  it still wasn't quite right. The taste was off and the cream
                  kept sinking.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This encouraged Koeppler to visit the source himself and find
                  out exactly how to make this coffee. He travelled to Joe
                  Sheridan in Limerick, Ireland to learn the correct way to make
                  this coffee.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On his return, Koeppler perfected the recipe that is still
                  used at the Buena Vista today. Sheridan was also offered a job
                  at The Buena Vista and he settled in San Francisco and worked
                  at The Buena Vista for ten years.
                </p>
                <h3>Variations</h3>
                <p>
                  When asking ‘what is an Irish coffee’, it’s not always easy to
                  get a straight answer, as there are many variations of this
                  coffee drink, often given the same name.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In Spain, Irish coffee can be served with a bottom layer of
                  whiskey, a separate coffee layer, and a layer of cream on top.
                  Often, special devices are used for making it. In Southeast
                  Asia, you may see a cocktail of iced coffee and whiskey,
                  sometimes without cream, under the name "Irish coffee" served.
                  Gaelic coffee is very similar to Irish coffee, but instead of
                  Irish whiskey, Scotch whiskey is used instead. And in Russia,
                  instead of Irish whiskey, vodka is used.
                </p>

                <h2>Iced Coffee</h2>
                <h3>What is an iced coffee?</h3>
                <p>
                  If you’re asking yourself ‘what is an iced coffee?’, then look
                  no further. Quite simply, an iced coffee is a cold version of
                  your favourite coffee, but it’s not simply a coffee that has
                  been left to cool. Like a regular coffee, it’s usually a
                  combination of hot espresso and milk. However, ice is added
                  too.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unlike a regular coffee, the iced version will not have frothy
                  or steamed milk, as it simply doesn't translate well into the
                  iced version. It’s because of this, that you may find less
                  milk is added to an iced coffee than a regular one, or it can
                  sometimes be even milkier. If this is the case, another shot
                  of espresso can be used.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You will likely find that the flavours of a regular coffee and
                  an iced one are also different. The iced version tends to be
                  less sweet.
                </p>
                <h3>What is Cold Coffee?</h3>
                <p>
                  Cold Coffee is a creamy and popular cold beverage that is made
                  from 3 main ingredients - coffee, sugar, and cold milk shaken
                  or blended well in a mixer grinder. Throw in a few ice cubes
                  while blending for a frothy finish. This creamy, frothy drink
                  is just the perfect indulgence on a hot summer day. It is
                  served with ice and sometimes topped with a dollop of vanilla
                  ice cream
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, while an Iced Coffee could be black and without sugar, the
                  Classic Cold Coffee is typically milky and sweet.

                <h3>What is a Café au Lait?</h3>
                <p>
                  The Café au Lait is made using brewed coffee and steamed milk,
                  in a typical ratio of one part coffee to one part steamed milk
                  with no froth or foam on top (sometimes certain coffee shops
                  will add it though). The coffee base is usually made with a
                  French press or a drip and the milk must always be steamed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Café au Lait is not the same as white coffee which is
                  brewed coffee with cold milk or powdered whitener added in.
                </p>
                <h3>Café au Lait origins</h3>
                <p>
                  The Café au Lait hails from France and in its home country the
                  phrase literally translates to ‘coffee with milk’. The
                  beverage dates back a long way and references to the Café au
                  Lait is found in the letters of Marie de Rabutin-Chantal, the
                  Marquise de Sévigné in the early to mid-17th century.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today the coffee is still enjoyed across France and it’s
                  traditionally served in an oversized mug or bowl for the
                  drinker to dunk pastries in during breakfast.
                </p>
                <h3>Variations of the Café au Lait</h3>
                <p>
                  Interestingly, the Café au Lait has many variations in
                  countries across the world, in Poland it’s known as the ‘Kawa
                  Biala’, Germany ‘Milchkaffee’, Hungary ‘Tejeskávé’, Dutch
                  ‘Koffie Verkeerd’ and in Brazil ‘Café com Leite’. One of the
                  most interesting distinct versions of the Café au Lait is
                  found in New Orleans where the coffee is combined with chicory
                  for a very strong, intense and bitter flavour that’s also
                  thicker in consistency. This variation dates back to the
                  American Civil War when coffee was very scarce so it was mixed
                  with chicory to make it last longer.

                <h2>Cold Brew</h2>
                <h3>What is Cold Brew?</h3>
                <p>
                  Cold brew coffee is made by slowly steeping coarsely
                  ground coffee beans in room temperature water for at least six
                  hours (it can be as much as up to 24, but it depends on how
                  strong you want your cold brew it to be, many choose to do it
                  overnight). When the beans are steeped like this it creates a
                  strong coffee concentrate that just needs to be mixed with
                  water and milk to taste.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the grounds aren’t exposed to hot temperatures, cold brew
                  coffee has a more flavourful, sweeter and less bitter and
                  acidic taste. In a recent study, cold brew coffee was found to
                  be between 50 – 67% less acidic than the average cup of
                  coffee.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It’s a common misbelief that cold brew has to be cold, in
                  actual fact it can be served piping hot too! If you want it
                  cold, simply add cold water, ice and milk (to taste) and for
                  hot you just need to boil water or add hot milk (some will
                  even pop it in the microwave if they’re in a rush).
                </p>
                <h3>Cold brew coffee origins</h3>
                <p>
                  The earliest version of cold brew was called ‘Kyoto’ and it
                  dates back to Japan in the 1600s. It was an incredibly popular
                  drink in the city, so much so that they eventually made cold
                  brew coffee machines, and made a spectacle out of brewing the
                  beverage in public places.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There has been some argument of whether cold brew was invented
                  in Japan, as many believe that it was introduced to the
                  country by Dutch traders that developed the process in order
                  to transport large quantities of strong coffee that could
                  later be reheated or enjoyed cold.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Interestingly, there’s been many documented accounts of cold
                  brew coffee being used for war rations too, which makes sense,
                  as the brewing method requires little equipment and requires
                  far less coffee
                </p>
                <h3>Does cold brew have more caffeine?</h3>
                <p>
                  Due to the fact it’s a coffee concentrate, many think that
                  cold brew has more caffeine content than the average cup.
                  However, the reality is that because you dilute this
                  concentrate, the caffeine level drops.

                <h2>Drip Coffee</h2>
                <h3>What is drip coffee?</h3>
                <p>
                  Drip coffee is made by pouring boiling water over ground
                  coffee (the grind of which being much coarser than espresso).
                  A filter that is typically made from paper separates the
                  grounds from the brewed liquid which allows the water to pass
                  through and fall into a pot or jug. However, you can now also
                  get coffee pots which are especially for drip coffee brewing
                  or electric options which you can set timers on so you can
                  choose what time it’s made.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When it comes to serving drip coffee it’s generally done in a
                  mug and can be drunk black or with milk and sugar to taste.
                </p>
                <h3>What is cold drip coffee?</h3>
                <p>
                  Cold drip coffee isn’t as well-known as it’s hot counterpart,
                  but it’s still becoming a noteworthy addition to the coffee
                  world. With this preparation method you’ll need a cold drip
                  apparatus or a drip tower, which is usually made up of three
                  glass containers that allows the iced water to slowly drip
                  over the freshly ground coffee. The coffee will then absorb
                  each drip of the water and this drops into another container
                  at the bottom of the tower. It’s a very long way to make
                  coffee and can take anywhere between 3.5 – 12 hours, depending
                  on how much of it you want to make.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In comparison to other brewing methods such as cold brew
                  coffee, cold drip is much stronger with a richer and fuller
                  body. In addition, it can also be shorter to make than cold
                  brew and uses less coffee grounds.
                </p>
                <h3>What does drip coffee taste like?</h3>
                <p>
                  Drip coffee is clean-bodied with a rounder, more simplistic
                  flavour profile. It’s often praised due to its mellow and less
                  intense flavour as it’s less concentrated than espresso.
                </p>
                <h3>Origin of drip coffee</h3>
                <p>
                  The brewing type was first developed in 19th centuryFrance and
                  quickly become the most popular way to prepare coffee. It
                  involved putting ground coffee into a container between two
                  chambers of a pot and adding heated water to the top chamber,
                  the coffee was then percolated and dripped down through the
                  coffee into the bottom serving receptacle.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the biggest developments in drip coffee came in 1908
                  when a German woman called Amalie Auguste Melitta Bentz
                  invented the first coffee filter. She soon patented her paper
                  filter and established the Melitta company and eventually
                  created the cone shaped filter you’re familiar with today.

                  Instant coffee is made from real coffee beans. The soluble and
                  volatile contents of the beans are extracted. Then the water
                  is removed so powder or concentrated soluble coffee powder are
                  left over. It’s essentially been dehydrated for our
                  convenience – just add water and you have yourself a brew!

                <h3>How to make instant coffee</h3>
                <p>
                  As we said before, instant coffee is easy! Simply follow these
                  4 steps:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Most importantly, pick your favourite mug.</li>
                  <li>
                    Add 2 teaspoons of instant coffee and boil your kettle.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Let your boiling water rest for 30 seconds (pouring fresh
                    boiling water onto coffee can lead to a bitter taste) and
                    fill up your mug.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Stir until the instant coffee is completely dissolved and
                    enjoy!
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  And there you have it – a beautifully rich coffee with minimal
                  fuss.

                <p>
                  Of course, some of us like a little extra pizazz in our coffee
                  cup. You can easily add a flavoured syrup (i.e., vanilla or
                  caramel) but instant coffee with milk is also a common way to
                  enjoy this drink.
                </p>
                <h3>Why choose instant coffee?</h3>
                <p>
                  If you’re not convinced already, instant coffee has a few more
                  benefits. As mentioned previously, there’s no residue, but it
                  also has a long shelf life, meaning it’s great in communal
                  areas or when you’re on the go. It’s also typically cheaper
                  than regular coffee too.
                </p>
                <p>Overall, instant coffee is a low-calorie beverage.</p>
